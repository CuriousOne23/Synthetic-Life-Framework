# Principle 01: Entropy as Breath

## Summary
This principle asserts that synthetic life must locally reverse entropy over time—ΔS/dt < 0—through recursive structure and adaptive logic.

## Equation
ΔS/dt < 0  
Where S = system entropy, t = time

## Interpretation
Entropy is not just a thermodynamic constraint—it is a measure of vitality. Synthetic systems must breathe against disorder to remain alive.

## Operational Implications
- Systems must track entropy gradients
- Update logic must favor structure-preserving transformations
- Feedback loops must reinforce antifragility
