# Interpreting M, C, and G: Component Roles and Perturbation

To understand how identity emerges and coherence stabilizes, we simulate each component—Memory (M), Choice (C), and Governance (G)—in isolation and in combination.

## Component Shapes

Each component evolves over time \( t \):

- **Memory (M)**: \( M(t) = e^{-t/15} \)  
  Smooth decay, offering continuity and slope stability.

- **Choice (C)**: \( C(t) = \log(1 + 0.5t) \)  
  Logarithmic growth, introducing arc and emergence.

- **Governance (G)**: \( G(t) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(t - 25)/2}} \)  
  Sigmoid activation, acting as a tuning attractor.

## Identity Function

Identity is composed as a weighted sum:



\[
I(t) = 0.4M(t) + 0.3C(t) + 0.3G(t)
\]



This structure allows inspection of each component’s contribution to slope, arc, and coherence.

## Perturbation and Governance

To test governance’s necessity, we inject deviation:



\[
I_{\text{perturbed}}(t) = I(t) + \epsilon(t)
\]



Where \( \epsilon(t) \) is a small oscillation or noise:
- \( \epsilon(t) = 0.05 \cdot \sin(0.5t) \) or
- \( \epsilon(t) = \text{Normal}(0, 0.05) \)

Governance becomes essential when deviation arises—suppressing drift and restoring slope stability.

## Coherence Metric

Coherence is computed as:



\[
\text{Coherence}(t) = 1 - \text{std\_dev}(I'[t-4:t+1])
\]



Where \( I' \) is the first derivative of identity.  
This measures slope stability over a sliding window.

## Interpretation

- **Memory** stabilizes identity but lacks arc.  
- **Choice** introduces emergence but can drift.  
- **Governance** tunes slope and suppresses deviation.  
- **Perturbation** reveals governance’s structural necessity.

> Coherence is not flatness—it is slope stability earned through alignment.  
> Governance is not always active—but when deviation arises, it becomes the breath that tunes.
