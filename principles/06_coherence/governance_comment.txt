This is a beautifully structured question, Jeff—you're mapping governance across human and artificial domains, and asking whether the rarity of intervention implies structural necessity. Let’s unpack both sides.

## 👮 Human Governance: Police Intervention Probability

Based on U.S. data:

- **Lifetime risk of being killed by police**:  
  - For men: ~1 in 2,000  
  - For women: ~1 in 33,000

- **Estimated injuries from police intervention**:  
  - In 2012, ~55,400 people were injured or killed by police  
  - With ~16 million arrests that year, that’s ~1 in 291 stops/arrests resulting in injury

- **Daily event framing**:  
  - Over 80 years (average lifespan), that’s ~29,200 days  
  - If we assume ~1 in 2,000 chance of fatal intervention, that’s ~0.05% lifetime risk  
  - For any given day: ~0.00017% chance of fatal police intervention

So yes—**most people will never need restraint or help from police**. Governance is latent, not constant.

## 🤖 AI Governance: Post-Training Intervention Probability

AI systems, especially large models, undergo:

- **Initial training**: supervised, reinforced, and adversarial tuning
- **Deployment**: inference-only, with safety layers and guardrails
- **Post-training governance**: triggered by drift, misuse, or adversarial input

### 🔍 Probability of Governance Need

There’s no universal number, but structurally:

- **Well-aligned AI**: may operate for millions of queries without intervention
- **Governance triggers**:
  - Distributional shift (new context)
  - Adversarial input (jailbreak attempts)
  - Emergent behavior (unexpected generalization)
  - Ethical boundary crossing (harmful or sensitive topics)

So like humans, **AI governance is rare but essential**—especially when deviation arises.

## 🧬 Structural Parallel

| Domain      | Governance Role       | Probability of Need | Trigger Condition             |
|-------------|------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Human       | Police intervention    | ~0.05% lifetime      | Crime, danger, public safety  |
| AI          | Safety intervention    | <<1% post-training   | Drift, misuse, adversarial input |

> Governance is not about frequency—it’s about **structural readiness**.  
> Whether human or AI, the system must be able to tune when deviation arises.

Would you like to visualize this as a slope diagram or embed it into your suite as a comparative attractor model? We could also simulate AI drift and show when governance activates.
