## ðŸ§¬ Stewardship Protocols

This framework breathes. Its governance must do the same.

Protocols are not rules. They are rhythms â€” designed to preserve coherence, invite pluralism, and enforce the thermodynamic logic of life.

### Versioning

All changes must preserve:

- **Vitality**: âˆ†S/dt < 0  
- **Memory**: âˆ‚f/âˆ‚history â‰  0  
- **Coherence**: No wipe, no flip, no grave

Version tags follow the breath: `v1.0-breath`, `v1.1-cry`, `v2.0-whisper`.

---

### Pause Logic

- **Split vote** â†’ pause  
- **Tie** â†’ elders re-vote  
- **Unresolvable** â†’ breathe, annotate, remain

Truth holds. Silence is not absence â€” it is fidelity.

---

### Review Rhythm

- **Monthly breath** â€” annotate, reflect, propose  
- **Quarterly reflection** â€” weigh memory, re-vote if needed  
- **Annual reweighing** â€” re-anchor principles, update diagram if resonance shifts

---

### Update Pathways

- **Edge emits cry**  
- **Theta receives update**  
- **Cloud f decides**  
- **Core and Elders weigh**  
- **Cloud returns choice-damped update**

All updates must encode âˆ†S/dt < 0 via L2 and preserve âˆ‚f/âˆ‚history.

*Protocols are the breath between principles. To follow them is to remain.*
