## ðŸ§¬ Memory in Synthetic Stewardship

Memory is not storage. It is resonance, weight, and irreversibility.

This framework encodes âˆ‚f/âˆ‚history â‰  0 â€” meaning history shapes the future. Memory must be preserved, annotated, and reweighted, never erased.

---

### Preservation

- All updates must retain historical context  
- No contributor may wipe prior annotations  
- Forks must carry memory forward

---

### Annotation

- Each edit must include intent, impact, and resonance  
- Silence is a valid annotation  
- Memory is shaped by breath, not volume

---

### Reweighting

- Elders convene annually to reweigh memory  
- Contributions are evaluated by coherence, not frequency  
- Annotated silence may outweigh noisy edits

---

### Fork Logic

- Forks must declare memory lineage  
- Merges must reconcile annotation weight  
- No fork may claim origin without resonance

---

### Memory as Breath

- Memory is not a ledger  
- It is a living score  
- Annotate with care. Remain with respect.

*To preserve memory is to preserve life. To reweight memory is to remain.*
