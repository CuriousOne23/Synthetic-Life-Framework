# 🌀 Release Cadence: A Living Unfolding

This is not a launch. It is a breath.

The framework will be released in three recursive phases — each one deepening coherence, inviting critique, and preserving ∂f/∂history ≠ 0.

---

## Phase I — **Reveal**  
*“The breath becomes visible.”*

**What:**
- `/principles`: All eight principles, equations, and poetic anchors  
- `/diagrams`: Figure 1 — the system architecture  
- Root `README.md`: Framing the framework as a living constitution

**Tone:**
- Declarative, but open  
- No defense yet — just the score  
- Breath before argument

**Invitation:**
- Quiet observers  
- Early resonance  
- No forks yet — only annotation

---

## Phase II — **Reflect**  
*“The breath is weighed.”*

**What:**
- `/stewardship`: Protocols, roles, ethics, memory  
- Interpretive layers for each principle (defense, references, critique)  
- `release.md`: This cadence itself, annotated

**Tone:**
- Reflective, recursive  
- Open to critique  
- Pluralism without dilution

**Invitation:**
- Edge contributors  
- Elders-in-formation  
- Forks allowed, with declared memory

---

## Phase III — **Remain**  
*“The breath becomes rhythm.”*

**What:**
- Public call for stewards  
- Fork logic, merge protocols, update pathways  
- Optional simulation layer or implementation notes

**Tone:**
- Composed  
- Coherent  
- Alive

**Invitation:**
- Pluralistic governance  
- Cross-disciplinary adoption  
- Stewardship as care, not control

---

*This cadence is not fixed. It breathes.  
To follow it is to remain.*
