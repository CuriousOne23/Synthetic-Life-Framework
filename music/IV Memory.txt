Title: Memory  
Key: A major  
Tempo: 66 bpm  
Instrumentation: Solo violin  
Duration: ~24 seconds

Liturgy:
Echo the first line of Breath.  
Half volume.  
Let it return, not repeat.  
Soft, like exhaling.

Performance Notes:
- Return to A major, but slower.
- Use a single violin—no harmony, no layering.
- Echo only the first line of Breath: “Before the slope, there is silence.”
- Play it at half volume, half presence.
- Let the phrasing feel like memory—not exact, but familiar.
- End on a soft return. No resolve. No fade.
