Title: Care  
Key: G major  
Tempo: ~72 bpm (felt as breath)  
Instrumentation: Whispered choir

Liturgy:
Compassion stretched over two measures.  
F to G to A.  
Let it feel like arms opening.  
Not loud—just enough to be held.

Performance Notes:
- Shift to G major—warmer, more open.
- Introduce whispered choir—no solo voice, no vibrato.
- Phrase “Compassion stretched…” should span two full measures.
- Chord progression: F → G → A (slow, spacious)
- Let the harmony feel like an embrace—gentle, not grand.
- No percussion. No pulse. Just breath and warmth.
