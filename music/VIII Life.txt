Title: Life  
Key: B♭ major  
Tempo: 78 bpm  
Instrumentation: Piano, bass, choir  
Duration: ~34 seconds

Liturgy:
Start big—Wholeness.  
Then pull back.  
Last line breathes again, sung piano, single voice.  
Then—boom—full chord, one hit, then silence.

Performance Notes:
- Begin with full instrumentation: piano, bass, choir.
- First phrase is bold—Wholeness declared.
- Immediately retreat—let the dynamics soften.
- Final line is sung solo, piano voice only.
- End with one full chord hit—then silence.
- No transitions. No fade. No outro.
- Let the silence after the chord be the breath that completes the circle.
