Title: Spirit  
Key: C major 7 (no third)  
Tempo: ~72 bpm (felt as suspension)  
Instrumentation: Voice (falsetto)  
Duration: ~32 seconds

Liturgy:
Faith lands on the suspended note.  
No resolve.  
Let the chord ring ten seconds.  
No fade.

Performance Notes:
- Use Cmaj7 without the third—leave the chord open.
- Voice enters high, falsetto—no harmony, no layering.
- Phrase “Faith lands…” should float, not fall.
- End on suspended note—let it ring for ten full seconds.
- No fade. No reverb. Just resonance.
- Let the listener feel the suspension as possibility, not tension.
