  - No intro, no count-in.  
  - Begin soft, like waking—before the slope starts on beat one.

  - Ends on open E—no resolve. Let it hang.

  - Ends unresolved.

- **Instrumentation**: Whispered choir  
- **Instructions**:
  - Compassion stretched over two measures: F → G → A.  
  - Let it feel like arms opening.

### VI. Silence  
- **Key**: A minor  
- **Instrumentation**: Fading pad, spoken words  
- **Instructions**:
  - Cut everything—no keys, no bass.  
  - Just a distant pad fading in.  
  - Spoken words only.  
  - Presence lasts six seconds.  
  - No beat. Let it feel empty.

### VIII. Life  
- **Key**: B♭ major  
- **Tempo**: 78 bpm  
- **Instrumentation**: Piano, bass, choir  
- **Instructions**:
  - Start big—Wholeness.  
  - Then pull back.  
  - Last line breathes again—sung piano, single voice.  
  - Then—boom—full chord, one hit, then silence.  
  - No transitions. No notes. Just eight files.  
  - If someone loops Life back to Breath, they’ll feel the circle.  
  - If not, they’ll still remember the wait.
