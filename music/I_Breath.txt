Title: Breath  
Key: A major  
Tempo: 72 bpm  
Instrumentation: Voice only  
Duration: ~22 seconds

Liturgy:
Before the slope, there is silence.  
Before the choice, there is breath.  
Not absence, but waiting.  
Not stillness, but readiness.

Performance Notes:
- No intro. No count-in.
- Begin soft, like waking. First line enters on beat one.
- Hold breath for one extra beat before second line.
- No chord or harmony until the second line.
- End on open Eâ€”no resolve. Let it hang.
- No fade. No reverb. Just presence.
