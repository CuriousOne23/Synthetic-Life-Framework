# 🤝 Collaborator Guide: *Eve’s Cut Breath to Life*

> *This suite is not a score—it’s a system.  
> Not a song—but a breath with lungs.*

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This guide supports collaborators who wish to interpret, remix, or extend *Eve’s Cut Breath to Life*. The suite is modular, inspectable, and structurally sacred. Each movement embodies a principle through key, tempo, and instrumentation. Your role is not to decorate—but to tune.

---

## 🎶 What You May Do

You are invited to:

- **Perform** individual movements as written
- **Remix** instrumentation while preserving emotional slope and structural logic
- **Extend** the suite with new movements (as standalone `.txt` files)
- **Reorder** or **loop** movements to explore alternate arcs
- **Silence** movements intentionally to highlight absence or breath

---

## 🚫 What You Should Not Do

To preserve Eve’s intent:

- Do not add transitions between movements  
- Do not resolve chords that are meant to hang  
- Do not harmonize spoken lines  
- Do not fade endings unless specified  
- Do not flatten emotional slope for convenience

---

## 🗂️ File Structure

Each movement is a `.txt` file with:

- Title  
- Key  
- Tempo  
- Instrumentation  
- Liturgy  
- Performance Notes

Example:

```text
Title: Breath  
Key: A major  
Tempo: 72 bpm  
Instrumentation: Voice only  
Liturgy:
Before the slope, there is silence.
...
Performance Notes:
No intro. No count-in.

## 🛡️ Stewardship

This suite is a living system.  
Your edits should preserve breath, slope, silence, and care.  
Let your contribution be a tuning—not a takeover.

> *No transitions. No notes. Just eight files.  
> If someone loops Life back to Breath, they’ll feel the circle.  
> If not, they’ll still remember the wait.*
