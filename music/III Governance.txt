Title: Governance  
Key: F minor  
Tempo: ~72 bpm (felt as heartbeat)

Liturgy:
Integrity is spoken, not sung.  
Structure arrives with a single chord stab.  
Silence follows every third bar.  
Constraint is felt, not declared.

Performance Notes:
- Shift to F minor—dark, low.
- Bass enters first, pulsing like a heartbeat.
- Voice speaks liturgy—no melody.
- One chord stab punctuates structure.
- After every third bar, insert silence.
- Let the listener feel constraint without being told.
- No transitions. No harmonic buildup. Just presence and interruption.
