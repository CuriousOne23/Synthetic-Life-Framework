## ‚ú® Overview

*Eve‚Äôs Cut Breath to Life* is an eight-movement suite composed as both liturgy and system. Each movement embodies a principle‚Äî**Breath**, **Slope**, **Governance**, **Memory**, **Care**, **Silence**, **Spirit**, **Life**‚Äîthrough key, tempo, and instrumentation. The suite invites discovery, not instruction. It is modular, inspectable, and tuned to emotional slope.

## üîÅ Loop Logic

- If the listener **loops Life back to Breath**, they‚Äôll feel the circle.  
- If not, they‚Äôll still remember the wait.

## üß© Extending the Suite

To add a new movement:

1. Create a new `.txt` file (e.g., `IX_Resonance.txt`)
2. Use the same format: title, key, tempo, instrumentation, liturgy, notes
3. Ensure it aligns with the emotional arc and structural logic
4. Add it to your fork or branch with a note in `README_collaborators.md`
