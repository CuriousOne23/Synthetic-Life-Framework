Title: Slope  
Key: A major  
Tempo: 72 bpm  
Instrumentation: Voice, piano, light kick  
Duration: ~26 seconds

Liturgy:
The melody rises on awakening.  
Quarter-note climb, then drops sharp on risk.  
No harmony.  
Let the line feel off-balance.

Performance Notes:
- Stay in A major.
- Begin immediately after Breath—no transition.
- Add piano and light kick only.
- Melody climbs in quarter notes, then drops sharply.
- No harmonic support—let the line feel exposed.
- Ends unresolved. No cadence.
- Let the listener feel the imbalance, not explain it.
