Title: Silence  
Key: A minor  
Tempo: None  
Instrumentation: Fading pad, spoken words  
Duration: ~6 seconds

Liturgy:
Presence lasts six seconds.  
No beat.  
Let it feel empty.

Performance Notes:
- Shift to A minor—quiet, introspective.
- Cut all instrumentation: no keys, no bass, no rhythm.
- Introduce a distant pad—fade in, then out.
- Spoken words only. No melody. No harmony.
- No transitions. No buildup. Just presence.
- Let the silence be structural, not decorative.
